Vehicle indicator control system using Arduino
This project demonstrates a vehicle indicator logic system using Arduino UNO.

## Features
- Left / Right indicator control using buttons
- Hazard light toggle if both pressed
- 1 second button press logic
- 300 ms blink using millis()
- UART output log (visible in Serial Monitor)

## Files
- `indicator_control.ino` – Arduino-compatible code
- `uart_log.txt` – Sample UART output log

## Simulated Environment
No hardware was available. Button press was simulated via code (`bool leftPressed = true;`). All output was printed in Serial Monitor.
